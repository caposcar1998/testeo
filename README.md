# SOLID

* S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):  Class should have only one responsibility or job.
* O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification
* L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types
* I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): classes should have narrowly focused interfaces tailored to the specific needs of their clients.
* D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules

# Architectures

* Factory: Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
* 

# poo

* Encapsulation: Data and methods that operate in same data
* Data Abstraction: Hiding implementation, interfaces and abstract classes
* Polymorphism: Object change behavior override
* Inheritance: get properties and methods from other classes

Concurrency: Multiple jobs with different timings, async await js
Parallelism: Multiple jobs at the same time, they are independent
